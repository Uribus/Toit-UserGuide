# Toit-Examples
Step by step user examples to Toit projects, high level code for ESP32.
Note that there is one big project including all dependencies, if you want the individual package dependencies, there is a link to each example from Toit where the specific packages are listed.

I built the projects in the following order: Hello, Time, Display and Telegram.
The idea is to include what I learnt from the previous project in the next one, so that the Telegram project should mix all the previous ones. That is why this is a big project, since the Telegram .toit file references .toit files from other folders.

Here, I assume that you have followed the first steps from [Toit](https://docs.toit.io/getstarted) for the IDE setup, and project initialization.

# [Hello](https://docs.toit.io/tutorials/setup/firstprogram)

This simple project helps introduce to the Toit language and does a simple console display.
